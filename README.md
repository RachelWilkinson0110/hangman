# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Milestone 2
In this section we used the random module to choose a fruit from a list of defined fruit.
I have also used the input function to request a single letter input from the user. To validate that this is a single letter I have used the len function (ensuring it is 1) and the isaplha() function (ensuring that the return is True).
